# Intent-Based Routing Chat Application - Updated Todo List

## Project Overview
Build a minimal intent-based routing chat application using Inworld Runtime with server-client architecture. The application will feature three core AI services: text chatbot, image generation, and image editing, with intelligent intent detection to route user requests appropriately.

## âœ… COMPLETED TASKS

### Configuration & Setup
- [x] **Server package.json Setup** - Added Express.js, TypeScript, @inworld/runtime, and all necessary dependencies
- [x] **Client package.json Setup** - Configured webpack, TypeScript, and development dependencies  
- [x] **Server tsconfig.json** - Configured strict TypeScript settings with proper module resolution
- [x] **Client tsconfig.json** - Set up strict TypeScript with DOM types and path mapping
- [x] **Client Build Setup** - Implemented webpack configuration with dev server and hot reload

### Core Server Foundation  
- [x] **Express.js Application Setup** - Created main Express app with CORS, helmet, and body parsing middleware
- [x] **Health Check Endpoint** - Implemented /health route with uptime and status information
- [x] **Error Handling Utilities** - Created AppError class and global error handler middleware
- [x] **Logger Configuration** - Set up Winston logger with file and console transports
- [x] **Configuration System** - Implemented Zod-based config validation with environment variables

### Basic Routes Structure
- [x] **Chat Routes Foundation** - Created chat route handlers for message, session creation/deletion

## ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS

### Critical Missing Service Implementation
- [ ] **ChatService Implementation** - Referenced in routes but not yet implemented
  - Needs to integrate with Inworld Runtime
  - Handle message processing and session management
  - Implement conversation context handling

## ðŸ“‹ PENDING HIGH PRIORITY TASKS

### Essential Missing Setup
- [ ] **Create .env.example File** - Document all required environment variables
- [ ] **Client Source Structure** - Create client/src directory with main application files  
- [ ] **Client HTML Template** - Create client/public/index.html file
- [ ] **Server Types/Interfaces** - Define TypeScript types for all services and data models

### Core Service Implementation
- [ ] **Inworld Runtime Integration** - Complete SDK setup with authentication and character management
- [ ] **Intent Detection System** - Build classification engine for routing user requests
- [ ] **Image Generation Service** - Integrate Black Forest Labs Flux API for text-to-image
- [ ] **Image Editing Service** - Integrate Black Forest Labs Flux API for image editing

### API Routes Completion
- [ ] **Image Routes** - POST /api/image/generate, POST /api/image/edit, GET/DELETE /api/image/:id
- [ ] **Intent Routes** - POST /api/intent/detect, GET /api/intent/types, POST /api/intent/route

## ðŸ“± CLIENT IMPLEMENTATION NEEDED

### Foundation (Not Started)
- [ ] **Client Application Bootstrap** - Create main app structure and entry point
- [ ] **Chat Interface Components** - Message display, input, and history scrolling  
- [ ] **Image Display Components** - Generated image viewer and upload interface
- [ ] **API Communication Layer** - HTTP client for server integration
- [ ] **State Management** - Application and session state handling

## ðŸ§ª TESTING & INTEGRATION (Future)

### Integration Testing
- [ ] **End-to-End Flow Testing** - Test complete chat, image generation, and editing workflows
- [ ] **Service Communication** - Verify server-client API communication
- [ ] **External API Integration** - Test Inworld Runtime and image service connections

## ðŸ“š RESEARCH TASKS (Ongoing)

### Technical Research  
- [ ] **Study Inworld Runtime SDK Documentation** - Character creation, authentication, event handling
- [ ] **Research Intent Detection Strategies** - Keyword vs ML approaches, confidence thresholds
- [ ] **Investigate Black Forest Labs Flux API** - FLUX.1 Kontext, Fill, and FLUX1.1 [pro] models

## ðŸ”§ DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

### Missing Server Dependencies
- [ ] **Add Missing Dependencies** - helmet, winston, zod (not in current package.json)

### Data Models & Types (High Priority)
- [ ] **Core Type Definitions** - ChatMessage, User, Session, Intent interfaces
- [ ] **Service Type Definitions** - ImageGenerationRequest/Response, IntentDetectionResult
- [ ] **Error Type Classes** - Custom error classes for different service failures

### Validation & Security
- [ ] **Input Validation Functions** - Request sanitization and schema validation  
- [ ] **File Upload Security** - Image file validation and size limits
- [ ] **Rate Limiting Middleware** - Protect against API abuse

## ðŸŽ¯ NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS

**Phase 1 (Critical Path):**
1. Create missing server dependencies and ChatService implementation
2. Set up .env.example with all required environment variables  
3. Create client directory structure (src/, public/)
4. Implement basic Inworld Runtime integration

**Phase 2 (Core Features):**
1. Build intent detection system
2. Add image generation and editing services  
3. Create client UI components and API integration
4. Complete end-to-end testing

## ðŸ“Š PROGRESS SUMMARY

**âœ… Completed (40% Foundation):**
- Server architecture and configuration
- Basic routing and middleware
- Build tools and TypeScript setup
- Error handling and logging framework

**ðŸš§ Critical Missing (60% Remaining):**
